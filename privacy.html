            <h2 id="info-collect">1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

            <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use How2Dunk, when you complete the onboarding quiz, or when you contact us.</p>

            <h3>Account Information (Sign in with Apple)</h3>
            <p><strong>In short:</strong> To use the app, you sign in with your Apple account. Depending on your choices with Apple, we may receive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Apple account identifier (used to authenticate you);</li>
                <li>Your name (if you choose to share it);</li>
                <li>Your email address or a private relay email created by Apple.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Training and Profile Data</h3>
            <p>To create your personalized jump program, we collect the information you provide in the onboarding and during your use of the app, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Height;</li>
                <li>Weight;</li>
                <li>Gender;</li>
                <li>Age;</li>
                <li>Ethnicity;</li>
                <li>Jump training experience;</li>
                <li>Current explosiveness level;</li>
                <li>Type of jumper;</li>
                <li>Desired number of workouts per week;</li>
                <li>Your workout history and progression inside the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> We do not collect or store photos, videos, biometric identifiers, or any other sensitive media. No facial recognition or similar biometric analysis is performed in How2Dunk.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Payment Data</h3>
            <p>When you make a purchase (for example an in-app subscription), the transaction is processed by Apple. We do not store your full payment card details. All payment data is stored and handled by Apple. You can find Apple’s privacy notice <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Information Automatically Collected</h3>
            <p><strong>In short:</strong> Some technical information may be collected automatically by our service providers (such as Apple, Supabase, or RevenueCat) when you use the app, for security, diagnostics, and analytics purposes. This can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device model and operating system version;</li>
                <li>Anonymous identifiers used to manage subscriptions and receipts;</li>
                <li>Basic usage events (such as app opens, subscription status changes, or critical errors).</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="how-process">2. How Do We Process Your Information?</h2>

            <p>We process your information to provide, improve, and secure How2Dunk. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating and updating your personalized jump program;</li>
                <li>Tracking your workouts and progression;</li>
                <li>Authenticating you and maintaining your account;</li>
                <li>Managing in-app purchases and subscriptions;</li>
                <li>Monitoring app performance and preventing fraud or abuse;</li>
                <li>Responding to your support requests and messages.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We do not use your data to perform biometric analysis, and we do not run any AI processing on your images or videos because How2Dunk does not collect such media.</p>

            <h2 id="legal-basis">3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On to Process Your Personal Information?</h2>

            <p><strong>In short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we have a valid legal basis to do so under applicable laws, such as your consent, a contract with you, our legitimate interests, or legal obligations.</p>

            <h3>If You Are Located in the EU or UK</h3>
            <p>Under the GDPR and UK GDPR, we may rely on the following legal bases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contract:</strong> To provide the app, personalize your program, and manage your subscription.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When you provide us with optional information or where required by law. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For example, to improve the app, prevent abuse, and secure our services, as long as these interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> When we are required to keep certain records or disclose information to comply with applicable laws.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If You Are Located in Canada</h3>
            <p>We may process your information based on your express or implied consent, or in other situations permitted by Canadian law (for example to investigate fraud, or where required by law).</p>

            <h2 id="sharing-info">4. When and With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>

            <p><strong>In short:</strong> We only share your information with a limited number of service providers who help us run the app, and they are contractually required to protect your data.</p>

            <p>We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> to host our database and store your account, onboarding, and training data.</li>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions using data from the Apple App Store.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple:</strong> for authentication (Sign in with Apple) and payment processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure and analytics providers:</strong> where necessary to host, secure, or monitor the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These third parties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are only allowed to use your information to perform the services we request;</li>
                <li>Must protect your information and keep it confidential;</li>
                <li>May not share your information with any other organization without our approval, unless required by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We may also share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> We do not sell your personal information, and we do not share your data with advertising networks for targeted ads.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="third-party">5. What Is Our Stance on Third-Party Services?</h2>

            <p>The app may contain links to third-party websites or services (for example, social media, external resources, or support tools). We are not responsible for the privacy and security practices of these third parties.</p>

            <p>Any data collected by third parties is governed by their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you use.</p>

            <h2 id="international-transfer">6. Is Your Information Transferred Internationally?</h2>

            <p><strong>In short:</strong> Yes, your information may be transferred, stored, and processed in countries other than your own.</p>

            <p>Our main data storage provider is Supabase, and we may also use other providers (such as RevenueCat and Apple) whose servers can be located in different countries. This means that your personal information may be transferred outside of your country of residence.</p>

            <p>When we transfer your personal information internationally, we take appropriate safeguards to protect it, for example by relying on data processing agreements and, where required, Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.</p>

            <p>You can contact us if you want more information about these safeguards.</p>

            <h2 id="data-retention">7. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>

            <p><strong>In short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to provide the app and its features, and no longer than 12 months after your last meaningful activity, unless a longer retention is required by law.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account and training data:</strong> We keep this data while your account is active. If you delete your account or stop using the app, we aim to delete or anonymize your personal data within 12 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Subscription and billing-related data:</strong> We may keep limited information related to purchases for as long as necessary for accounting, tax, or legal purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical logs and diagnostics:</strong> These may be retained for a shorter period (for example up to 12 months) to secure the app and investigate issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> When we no longer need your personal information, we will delete it or anonymize it so that it can no longer identify you.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="data-security">8. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>

            <p><strong>In short:</strong> We use a combination of technical and organizational security measures to protect your data.</p>

            <p>These measures include, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption of data in transit and, where applicable, at rest;</li>
                <li>Access controls so that only authorized people and services can access the data they need;</li>
                <li>Use of reputable cloud providers with strong security practices (such as Supabase);</li>
                <li>Regular monitoring for potential security incidents.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures. The transmission of personal data to and from the app is at your own risk. You should use a secure device and keep your login information confidential.</p>

            <h2 id="minors-data">9. Do We Collect Information from Minors?</h2>

            <p>How2Dunk is not specifically directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children where this is restricted by law (such as under COPPA in the United States).</p>

            <p>If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under the applicable age of consent without appropriate parental consent, we will take steps to delete that data as soon as possible.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@brslabs.xyz">contact@brslabs.xyz</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="privacy-rights">10. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>

            <p><strong>In short:</strong> Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the use of your personal information.</p>

            <p>In particular, in the EEA, UK, Switzerland, Canada, and some other regions, you may have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request access to your personal data and obtain a copy;</li>
                <li>Request rectification (correction) of inaccurate data;</li>
                <li>Request deletion of your data in certain circumstances;</li>
                <li>Restrict or object to certain types of processing;</li>
                <li>Request data portability, where applicable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the details in the “How to Contact Us” section below. We may ask you to verify your identity before responding to your request.</p>

            <h3>Opting Out of Marketing Communications</h3>
            <p>How2Dunk currently does not send marketing emails or SMS messages. If we introduce such communications in the future, you will always have the option to opt out.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Contact Us:</strong> If you have questions or would like to exercise your rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:contact@brslabs.xyz">contact@brslabs.xyz</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="dnt-controls">11. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>

            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal that you prefer not to have online browsing activities monitored and collected.</p>

            <p>Because no uniform standard for recognizing DNT signals has been adopted, we do not currently respond to DNT signals. If a standard is adopted in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>

            <h2 id="us-privacy-rights">12. Do United States Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>

            <p><strong>In short:</strong> If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia, or other U.S. states with privacy laws, you may have additional rights regarding your personal information.</p>

            <p>These rights can include the right to request access, deletion, or correction of your personal information and the right to limit certain uses of your data. To exercise any of these rights, you can contact us at the email address provided below.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Contact:</strong> For privacy-related requests from U.S. residents, please email <a href="mailto:contact@brslabs.xyz">contact@brslabs.xyz</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="regional-privacy-rights">13. Do Other Regions Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>

            <p>If you live in a country with specific data protection laws (for example Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa), you may have additional rights similar to those described above. We will comply with these laws when processing your personal information.</p>

            <p>If you believe we have processed your data unlawfully, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. We encourage you to contact us first so we can try to resolve the issue.</p>

            <h2 id="policy-updates">14. Do We Make Updates to This Notice?</h2>

            <p><strong>In short:</strong> Yes, we will update this Privacy Policy when necessary to remain compliant with applicable laws and to reflect changes in the app.</p>

            <p>The “Last updated” date at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes will become effective when we post the revised version. If we make material changes, we may also notify you through the app or by other appropriate means.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Stay informed:</strong> We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly so you know how your information is protected.</p>
